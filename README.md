# Clean Twitter

<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/clean-twitter?utm_source=badge-featured&utm_medium=badge&utm_souce=badge-clean&#0045;twitter" target="_blank"><img src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=401819&theme=light" alt="Clean&#0032;Twitter - Some&#0032;features&#0032;of&#0032;cleaning&#0032;Twitter | Product Hunt" style="width: 250px; height: 54px;" width="250" height="54" /></a>

Some features of cleaning Twitter include: Blue check, Twitter Blue, Verified Organization, Communities, Trending, Search & Explore, Who to follow, For you. All gone.

Support for multiple languages:

- en-US
- zh-CN
- zh-TW
- ja-JP

If you want to support a new language, you can add a new language file under the `src/i18n` directory, which should at least include the `symbol.` part of Twitter's translation, which is used as a dependency for the CSS selector.

## Installation

Download the zip file from [Release](https://github.com/rxliuli/clean-twttier/releases), unzip it and load the unpacked extension with Chrome. Alternatively, install it from the Chrome store (not yet approved).

## Limitations

Due to Firefox's lack of support for the CSS feature `:has`, there is no Firefox version of this plugin. Refer to: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has#browser_compatibility>
