# Clean Twitter

Some features of cleaning Twitter include: Blue check, Twitter Blue, Verified Organization, Communities, Trending, Search & Explore, Who to follow, For you. All gone.

Support for multiple languages:

- en-US
- zh-CN
- zh-TW
- ja-JP

If you want to support a new language, you can add a new language file under the `src/i18n` directory, which should at least include the `symbol.` part of Twitter's translation, which is used as a dependency for the CSS selector.

## Installation

Download the zip file from [Release](https://github.com/rxliuli/clean-twttier/releases), unzip it and load the unpacked extension with Chrome. Alternatively, install it from the Chrome store (not yet approved).

## Limitations

Due to Firefox's lack of support for the CSS feature `:has`, there is no Firefox version of this plugin. Refer to: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has#browser_compatibility>
