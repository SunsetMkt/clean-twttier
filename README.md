# Clean Twitter

Some features of cleaning Twitter include: Blue check, Twitter Blue, Verified Organization, Communities, Trending, Search & Explore, Who to follow, For you. All gone.

Support for multiple languages:

- en-US
- zh-CN
- zh-TW
- ja-JP

If you want to support a new language, you can add a new language file under the `src/i18n` directory, which should at least include the `symbol.` part of Twitter's translation, which is used as a dependency for the CSS selector.
